Heartland city map for Minetest

This is the first major city map for minetest i have created. This took me a few months and is a work in progress. You will find 2 downloads, the city and all the mods used.

1. Heartland City - The city is periodically being built
1. Mods - All of the mods conveniently added into a zip

You are welcome to download the city and modify for your own needs, give us a shout out somewhere if you use any part of the city. Check back every so often for updated versions of the city with more stuff added.
